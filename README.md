# 68k Disassembler

Original 68k Disassembler I wrote for Hatari &lt;https://hatari.tuxfamily.org> in 2010.

It does support all 68k CPUs, including the embedded ones, FPU and PMMU.

It doesn't compile on it's own, but requires Hatari source code. But it should be possible with minimal effort to make it stand-alone.
